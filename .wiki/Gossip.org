#+BRAIN_PARENTS: Protocols

IOTA uses the Gossip protocol for transaction
propagation. Transactions of sufficient weight can efficiently
propagate across the cluster. This is how PoW is related to the
underlying Gossip protocol. Without PoW a message will not have the
initial weight that is needed for the Gossip protocol to begin
propagation.
