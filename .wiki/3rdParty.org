#+BRAIN_PARENTS: index Implementation

#+TITLE:3rd party code

When posting to IOTA, a seed must be stored on the device of a user. A major
mode should not have to do key management, but this should be handled by a core
part of the software. It should:

1. securely store the iota seed
2. hold known public keys (contact list)
3. ask the user for confirmation for every tx that a mode generates
4. provide (Part of) the iota web api.

Metamask is a good example of this. In IOTA, everyone seems obsessed about
putting devices on tangle, no real effort is being put into putting humans on
there. However, there might be some interest if we pitch the idea there.
