#+TITLE:Protocols

When a device subscribes to a topic, there are a number of different
models available:

1. Gossip - A peer-2-peer communication protocol where messages
   propagate through a network like gossip in an office or a virus
   during an epidemic.
2. Consensus - The IOTA consensus protocol adds integrity to the
   Gossip message stream.
3. Masked Authenticated Messages- is a second layer data communication
   protocol which adds functionality to emit and access an encrypted
   data stream, like RSS, over the Tangle (IOTAâ€™s distributed ledger).
4. [[https://medium.com/@samuel.rufinatscha/mam-lite-a-more-flexible-messaging-protocol-for-iota-562fdd318e1d][mam-lite]] - messages must be read from a topic that changes over
   time. Anyone can send to the topics, a major should decide which
   messages to show or hide.
   
We could also think about:

1. Signal protocol - diffie helman exchange with public one-time keys
   to set up 1 to 1 conversation.
2. Fixed public topics - anyone can send to a fixed topic, major modes
   should choose which messages to show or hide.
   
Major modes must be able to share protocol code
