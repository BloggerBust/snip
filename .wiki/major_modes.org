#+TITLE:Major Modes

A topic is chosen to publish messages to. The major mode will contain rules
about the messages posted in this topic. A topic could have a human readable
name - say geo_chat_worldwide, and a major mode being geo_chat. A user could
subscribe their device to this channel using this major mode, and the phone
would then be able to show the user a coherent set of posts, since the phone
knows how to handle the posts sent to this topic. If the mode cannot parse the
message, we can assume it is malicious or an error, and the post doesn't need to
be shown.
