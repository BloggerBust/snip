#+BRAIN_PARENTS: Protocols

A second layer data communication protocol which adds functionality to
emit and access an encrypted data stream, like RSS, over the Tangle
(IOTA’s distributed ledger).

Encryption is achieved using a [[https://www.imperialviolet.org/2013/07/18/hashsig.html][merkel based signature scheme]]. Each
message is encrypted with a one-time pad that consists of the channel
ID and the index of the key used to sign the message; an additional
nonce may be used as a revocable encryption key. The resulting cipher
hash is signed using the private key belonging to one of the leaves of
the merkel tree. The encrypted payload, the signature and the leaf’s
siblings are then published to the tangle where anyone knowing the
symmetric key can find and decrypt it.

Signature verification consists of validating the signature and
verifying that the signature belongs to one of the tree’s leaves. If
signature verification fails, the entire message is deemed
invalid. Otherwise, the message is unmasked.

Messages that are sent to a specific address
must be read. The address changes over time. A password can be
optionally added/changed to limit access to a stream. Only one private
key can send valid packets to the addresses.
