#+BRAIN_PARENTS: Implementation

I was interested in building our protocol on top of IOTA using BEEP
and extending it to be a suitable protocol for social networks in
general. That way we abstract away the fact that we are building on
top of the IOTA. Any application that speaks BEEP will be able to
interopt with our social network. Only, on further reading and
investigation BEEP seems to have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEEP][lost community interest back in
2016]]. Now I think we should just Extend the IOTA / MAM2 protocols into
our own Distributed Social Networking Protocol. The way to do that is
to use TangleChat's needs as a basis for where to begin in building a
generic distributed social networking protocol and hopefully we get it
right.
