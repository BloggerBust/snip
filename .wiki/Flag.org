#+BRAIN_PARENTS: minor_modes

#+TITLE:Flag
- A message with transaction id {tx_id} can be flagged by sending a message
  to topic flag_{tx_id}.
- The flag tx should be signed with an rsa key
- The flag tx should have a flag value. These might be anything, but I guess
  NSFW, NSFL, Racism would be some common flags.
- The minor mode could filter messages that have been flagged >x times
- The flag tx might be encrypted, if the major mode uses an encryption scheme (needs more thought)
